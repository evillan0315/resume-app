## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- Git

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/evillan0315/resume-app.git
    cd resume-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    # or
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following variables. These should match your backend configuration.

    ```dotenv
    # API Base URL for the backend
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Adjust if your backend runs on a different port or host

    # Frontend URL (used for OAuth redirects from backend)
    VITE_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001 # Adjust if your frontend runs on a different port

    # Google OAuth credentials (get these from Google Cloud Console)
    VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
    VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET # Not directly used by frontend, but good to have if needed
    VITE_GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback # Must match backend and Google Console

    # GitHub OAuth credentials (get these from GitHub OAuth Apps)
    VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
    VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET # Not directly used by frontend
    VITE_GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/github/callback # Must match backend and GitHub OAuth settings
    ```

4.  **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    # or
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend application will typically run on `http://localhost:3001`.

### Backend Setup

This frontend application requires a running backend service to provide AI capabilities and authentication. Please refer to the [backend repository](https://github.com/evillan0315/project-board-server) for setup instructions. Ensure your backend is configured to run on the `VITE_API_URL` specified in your `.env` file (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## Usage

Once the frontend and backend servers are running, open your browser to `http://localhost:3001` (or your configured `VITE_FRONTEND_URL`).

- **Login**: Use the Google or GitHub OAuth options to sign in.
- **Resume Upload/Input**: Navigate to the 'Upload / Input Resume' tab to either upload a file or paste your resume content.
- **Job Description**: Provide the job description you want to tailor your resume for.
- **Optimize**: Click 'Optimize Resume' to get an optimization score and detailed suggestions.
- **Generate/Enhance**: Switch to the 'Generate / Enhance Resume' tab to create a new resume from a prompt or enhance existing content.
