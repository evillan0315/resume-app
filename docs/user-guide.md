# User Guide: Resume AI Assistant

Welcome to the Resume AI Assistant! This guide will walk you through how to effectively use the application to optimize, generate, and enhance your resume.

## 1. Getting Started

Before you can use the AI features, you need to sign in.

### Signing In

1.  Open the application in your browser (e.g., `http://localhost:3001`).
2.  Click the 'Login' button in the top navigation bar.
3.  On the login page, choose to 'Sign in with Google' or 'Sign in with GitHub'. You will be redirected to the respective OAuth provider to authenticate.
4.  After successful authentication, you will be redirected back to the Resume Generator page, and your user profile (name/email) will be displayed in the Navbar.

> **Note**: Traditional email/password login is not currently available on the frontend; please use the OAuth options.

## 2. Optimizing Your Existing Resume

This feature helps you tailor your current resume to a specific job description to increase its relevance.

### Steps:

1.  **Navigate to 'Upload / Input Resume' Tab**: This is the default tab when you first arrive on the main page.

2.  **Provide Your Resume Content** (Choose one):
    - **Upload Resume File**: Click 'Choose File' under 'Upload Resume File'. Select your resume file (PDF or DOCX). Once selected, click 'Parse File to Text'. The parsed text will appear in the 'Resume Content' text area.
    - **Enter Resume Text Manually**: Directly paste your resume's plain text content into the 'Resume Content' text area. If you uploaded a file, this text area will be pre-filled with the parsed content.

3.  **Provide Job Description**: Paste the full job description you are applying for into the 'Job Description' text area.

4.  **Optimize Your Resume**: Click the 'Optimize Resume' button.

### Understanding Optimization Results:

After optimization, you will see a new section titled 'Resume Optimization Results' with:

- **Optimization Score**: A percentage indicating how well your resume matches the job description.
- **Tailored Summary**: An AI-generated summary of your qualifications, specifically highlighting your fit for the job.
- **Detailed Suggestions**: A list of actionable recommendations for improving your resume, categorized by type (e.g., Keywords, Formatting, Content).
- **Example Improved Section (Optional)**: In some cases, the AI may provide an example of how a specific section of your resume could be rephrased for better impact.

## 3. Generating a New Resume

If you don't have an existing resume or want a fresh start, you can generate one using AI.

### Steps:

1.  **Navigate to 'Generate / Enhance Resume' Tab**: Click on this tab at the top of the main content area.

2.  **Enter Generate Resume Prompt**: In the 'Generate New Resume' section, provide a detailed prompt describing the kind of resume you need. Be specific about your experience, skills, desired role, and any sections you want to include.
    - _Example Prompt_: "Generate a resume for a junior full-stack developer with 2 years of experience in React and Node.js. Include a project section for an e-commerce site I built using MERN stack. I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science. Focus on problem-solving and collaboration."

3.  **Generate Resume**: Click the 'Generate Resume' button.

### Viewing Generated Resume:

The AI-generated resume will appear in the 'Generated Resume' section below the forms. This content will also automatically update the 'Current Resume Content' in the 'Upload / Input Resume' tab, allowing you to then optimize it.

## 4. Enhancing Existing Resume Sections

This feature allows you to refine specific parts of your resume or give general enhancement instructions.

### Steps:

1.  **Navigate to 'Generate / Enhance Resume' Tab**: Ensure you are on this tab.

2.  **Provide Resume Content to Enhance**: The 'Resume Content to Enhance' text area will automatically be pre-filled with your currently loaded resume content (either parsed from a file or generated by AI). You can also paste different content here if needed.

3.  **Specify Section (Optional)**: If you want to enhance only a particular part of your resume (e.g., 'Summary', 'Experience', 'Skills'), enter the name of that section in the 'Specific Section to Enhance' field.

4.  **Define Enhancement Goal (Optional)**: Describe what kind of improvement you're looking for. This helps the AI understand your intent.
    - _Examples_: 'Make more concise with strong action verbs', 'Add quantifiable achievements', 'Target leadership roles', 'Improve readability'.

5.  **Enhance Resume**: Click the 'Enhance Resume' button.

### Viewing Enhanced Resume:

The AI-enhanced resume (or enhanced section) will be displayed in the 'Enhanced Resume' section. This updated content will also replace the 'Current Resume Content' for further operations.

## Troubleshooting

- **Error Messages**: If an error occurs, a red alert message will appear at the top of the screen. Read the message for details, and try to adjust your input or action accordingly.
- **Loading Indicators**: Look for circular progress indicators next to buttons or a linear progress bar at the top to see if an AI operation is still in progress.
- **No Results**: If you don't see results, ensure all required fields (resume content, job description/prompt) are filled and that you've clicked the correct action button.

If you encounter persistent issues, please refer to the [Developer Guide](./developer-guide.md) or contact support (if applicable).
